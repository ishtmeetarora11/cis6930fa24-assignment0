# FBI Data Extraction and Modification

Name: Ishtmeet Singh Arora

## Project Description

This project is focused on retrieving and reformatting data from the FBIâ€™s Most Wanted API. The goal is to build a Python package that, when provided with a page number or a local JSON file, fetches data about wanted individuals and outputs a thorn-separated CSV file. The data contains important fields like the name or title of the wanted individual, the subjects related to the case, and the FBI field offices handling the case. The program is designed to extract this information and print it to the console in the specified format.

## How to install

pipenv install -e .

## How to run

pipenv run python main.py --page <integer>

OR

pipenv run python main.py --file <file-location>
